# JavaScript Calculator

This project is a simple, fully functional calculator implemented in JavaScript without using the `eval` function, as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Responsive Design:** The calculator adjusts its layout based on the screen size, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Keyboard Support:** Users can interact with the calculator using their keyboard, including entering numbers, operators, and executing calculations with the "Enter" key.

## Implementation Details

The calculator logic avoids using the `eval` function, opting instead for a more manual parsing and execution of arithmetic operations. This ensures better security and reliability, preventing any unintended execution of arbitrary code. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean, maintainable code.

This project demonstrates key programming concepts and best practices, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive web design, as outlined in The Odin Project.
